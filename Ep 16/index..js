// ECMAScript language Standard

// ECMASCript Engine has many versions for differnt Browsers like v8 for Google/node, and Chakra for Edge.

// The ECMAScript standard is the base for all these engines. It defines the syntax and semantics of the language.

// Developed by Brendan Eichin

// Code - Parsing - Compilation - Execution

// Parsing means breaking the code into tokens. Tokens are the basic building blocks of the code.

// Syntax Parser takes code and convert into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

// AST is a tree like data structure where each node represents a token in the code.

// JIT Compilation - Just In Time Compilation
// JIT compilation is a technique used by some JavaScript engines to improve performance. It involves compiling the code into machine code just before it is executed.

// JS is interpreted language

// Mark & Sweep
// Inlining 
// Copy Elision
// Inline Caching

// v8 is fastest JS Engine,  It has interpreter name as Ignition and Compiler name as TurboFan. Has a garbage collector name as Orinoco, oilpay
