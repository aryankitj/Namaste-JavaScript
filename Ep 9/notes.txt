Block Scope

{
    this is a block
    it groups multiple statement and can be used where only single statement is allowed
}

Shadowing means reassigning the variable to a new value, which can be different from the original value.  (in let and var)
The limitation is shadowing shouldnt cross the boundary of earlier variable


var is function scoped, let and const are block scoped
