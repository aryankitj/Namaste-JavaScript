Let & Const are also hoisted
but...
these are in temporal dead zone 
temporal dead zone is time betwwen variable declared and assigned a value  

var is decalred in global object while let and const are decalred in seperate object

let variable can be reassigned and const can't.

const can be only initialized and that is one time only.
